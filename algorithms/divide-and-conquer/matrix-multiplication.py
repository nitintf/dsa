Matrix Multiplication using Divide and Conquer (Standard Approach)

This algorithm recursively multiplies two square matrices A and B of size n x n
(assuming n is a power of 2) by breaking them into smaller submatrices.

Steps:
1. Divide each matrix into four (n/2 x n/2) submatrices.
2. Recursively multiply the parts to compute intermediate products.
3. Combine the results to build the final matrix.

Time Complexity: O(n^3)

Why this isn't optimal:
- Although it's a clean recursive approach, it performs 8 recursive multiplications,
  just like the standard iterative method, so its asymptotic complexity is the same.
- Strassenâ€™s algorithm improves on this by reducing the number of recursive multiplications
  from 8 to 7, achieving a time complexity of approximately O(n^2.81), which is faster
  for large matrices.

This implementation is useful as a stepping stone to understanding more advanced
matrix multiplication algorithms like Strassen's or Winograd's.
