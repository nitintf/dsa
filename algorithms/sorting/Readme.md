1. **Bubble Sort**:
   - Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst and average case, O(n) in the best case (when the array is already sorted).
   - Space Complexity: O(1) as it sorts in-place.
   - Benefit: Easy to understand and implement.
   - Best for: Small arrays or when the array is nearly sorted.

2. **Selection Sort**:
   - Time Complexity: O(n^2) regardless of the input.
   - Space Complexity: O(1) as it sorts in-place.
   - Benefit: Simple, and doesn't require much memory.
   - Best for: Small arrays with a minimum number of swaps.

3. **Insertion Sort**:
   - Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst and average case, O(n) in the best case (when the array is already sorted).
   - Space Complexity: O(1) as it sorts in-place.
   - Benefit: Efficient for small arrays or nearly sorted data.
   - Best for: Small arrays or when data is continuously added to an already sorted list.

4. **Quick Sort**:
   - Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst case (rare), O(n log n) on average.
   - Space Complexity: O(log n) for the recursive call stack.
   - Benefit: Fast and efficient for large datasets, in-place sorting.
   - Best for: Large datasets or general-purpose sorting.

5. **Merge Sort**:
   - Time Complexity: O(n log n) in all cases.
   - Space Complexity: O(n) due to the need for auxiliary storage.
   - Benefit: Stable sort and efficient for large datasets.
   - Best for: Large datasets and when stability is important.

6. **Heap Sort**:
   - Time Complexity: O(n log n) in all cases.
   - Space Complexity: O(1) as it sorts in-place.
   - Benefit: Efficient and can be used as an in-place sorting algorithm.
   - Best for: When both time and space are important.

7. **Counting Sort**:
   - Time Complexity: O(n + k), where k is the range of input.
   - Space Complexity: O(k) for the counting array.
   - Benefit: Very fast for a limited range of input values.
   - Best for: Sorting integers in a small range.

8. **Radix Sort**:
   - Time Complexity: O(n * k), where k is the number of digits in the maximum number.
   - Space Complexity: O(n) for the auxiliary storage.
   - Benefit: Efficient for sorting integers with a fixed number of digits.
   - Best for: Sorting large integers with a fixed number of digits.

The best sorting algorithm depends on your specific use case. Quick Sort and Merge Sort are often good general-purpose choices for large datasets. Bubble, Selection, and Insertion Sorts are simpler but less efficient. Counting and Radix Sorts are excellent for specialized cases with known constraints.
