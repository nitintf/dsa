# Stacks

### Methods

1. Push (push element to last of stack) `O(1)`
2. Pop (remove last element from stack) `O(1)`
3. Peek (return last element of stack) `O(1)`

### Applications

1. In stack-oriented programming lang.
2. Geaphs AlgoL depth first search can be implemented with stacks (or with
   recursion)
3. Finding Euler-cycles in graph
4. Find strongly connected components in graph
